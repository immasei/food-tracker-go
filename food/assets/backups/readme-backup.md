### What is functioning
- Food List main page is fully functioning. This is our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- Login/Signup functions are fully functioning. User data will synchronize to our Google Firebase backend and database.
- User and Settings pages have basic interfaces. User details can be displayed, but some backend functions are to be implement.
- Camera page based on our mini project. Camera function is working.
- Recipe page is passing ingredients with prompts and able to receive the recipe.

### TODO items
- Add backend functions to many pages.
- Fix the tab bar display problem.
- Add AI receipt recognition function.
- Add food sharing function.

### Current challenges
- Recipe page needs to pass dynamic ingredient since it is passing preset ingredient. Enable user to adjust prompt in high level.
- Integrating a map SDK for food sharing function is challenging.
- We are encountering a lot of bugs while creating new functions.
