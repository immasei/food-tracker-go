## Introduction

Do you often throw away expired food because of forgetting the expiry date? Responsible consumption and production is one of the United Nations sustainable goals. 

To address the food waste problem caused by food expiration and respond to the UN Sustainable Goal, we developed a mobile app named **Food Tracker Go**. The app helps you reduce food waste by tracking expiry dates and sending notifications before your food expires.

Our main purpose is to help you consume food before it expires to avoid food waste by mobile phone notifications. The app has basic features including adding and management of food items. Then it will track the expiration dates and send reminder notifications. To minimize food waste as much as possible, we also have AI recipe recommendation function and a self-pick-up food sharing feature with users nearby.
